# Facial_Emotion_Recognition_using_CNN
Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deadskull7/fer2013

This project is a Facial Emotion Recognition system developed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. It can identify a range of human emotions from facial expressions captured in images, making it suitable for various applications, such as human-computer interaction, mental health monitoring, and more.

<h2>Project Structure</h2>
<h4>FER.ipynb:</h4>Jupyter notebook with code for loading data, building the CNN model, training, evaluation, and prediction.
model.h5: Saved model file (HDF5 format) for easy loading and deployment.

<h4>config.json:</h4>JSON file containing model configuration, data preprocessing details, and hyperparameters.

<h2>Features</h2>
<h4>Emotion Detection :</h4> Detects primary emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and neutral.
<h4>Data Preprocessing:</h4> Preprocessing steps for face detection, resizing, and normalization.
<h4>Model Architecture:</h4> Utilizes a CNN architecture optimized for feature extraction and classification tasks.
<h4>Evaluation Metrics:</h4> Tracks accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix to assess model performance.
<h4>Live Video Emotion Detection:</h4> After training the final model, it can detect emotions in real-time from a live video feed or webcam input.

<h2>Achieved Accuracy :  81.05831742286682 %</h2>
